# Hey, I'm the shmunguss.

I am 14 years old. The main focus of my GitHub is to create open-source, easy methods to surf the web without censorship from corporations, your workplace, your school, anything. I do this via premade web proxies I have outsourced from many, all of which act as web browsers in a web browser.

You can check out the project I'm currently working on, RamOS Web, either below or [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8ab2625-5b25-47e2-92bc-ecc6abd2d4ca). Thanks for visiting my profile!
